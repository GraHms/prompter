## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what’s best for the community and the project
- Showing empathy toward other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination in any form
- Physical or verbal abuse of any participant
- Public or private insults, slurs, or derogatory remarks
- Posting sexually explicit or violent content
- Deliberate misgendering or use of “dead” or rejected names

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at **grahms@outlook.com**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
